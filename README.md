## I mainly made this for myself and didn't want to make a guide, but here's a shitty guide anyway
## If you're trying to set this up in the first place, I'm assuming you're a more advanced user so you shouldn't have too much trouble

# Prerequisites
* Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) for windows or whatever meme distro you use 

# Running the thing

* Clone this repository `git clone {insert the repository URL im not going to paste it for you}` (Or download it as a zip from the "clone or download" button if you're too dumb to use git) 
* go into the directory and open a terminal
* run `npm i` if it says npm is not recognized or whatever you didn't install nodejs correctly so you should just give up now
* fill out the config.js file with the modifications you want to make (details in that file) (make sure to save the god damn file after writing everything)
* run `npm run patch`, this will apply all the modifications and make a backup to the path you specified beforehand 
    * if you somehow fucked this up and lost your dashboard-ui even though a backup was made just give up and stop tryiung
